# Upstream Feedback — Surface CoR Friction to the Source

**Position:** Runs after record-lessons (step 7), before capture loose
ends (step 8). Lessons are fresh; friction is top of mind.

**This is an instruction phase** — it tells Claude what to do, not a
customization point for the project. It ships with CoR and should not
be deleted or replaced with `skip: true`.

## What This Phase Does

During debrief, Claude already has full session context: what was built,
what went wrong, what was learned. This phase asks Claude to reflect on
one narrow question: **was there friction with anything CoR provided?**

- A skill whose flow didn't match how the project actually works
- A phase file whose default behavior was wrong or confusing
- A convention that fought the project's grain
- A missing capability that required a workaround
- An unclear SKILL.md that led to wasted time

This is NOT the same as `/extract` (which looks for generalizable
artifacts to upstream). This is field feedback — "this thing you shipped
hurt when I used it."

## Workflow

### 1. Claude Reflects (silent)

Review the session for CoR-specific friction. Consider:

- Did any CoR skill need to be worked around or used in an unintended way?
- Did a phase file's default behavior cause confusion or extra work?
- Was a SKILL.md unclear, leading to misinterpretation?
- Did the skeleton/phase separation feel wrong for something?
- Was something missing that would have helped?
- Did orient or debrief surface irrelevant information or miss something important?

If nothing comes to mind — **stop here silently**. Most sessions have
no CoR friction. Do not prompt the user with "any CoR feedback?" every
time. The phase produces nothing and costs nothing unless there's
something real.

### 2. Draft Feedback (if friction found)

For each friction point, draft a short feedback item:

```
## [Short title]

**Skill/phase:** [which CoR component]
**Friction:** [what happened — 2-3 sentences max]
**Suggestion:** [what might be better — optional, can be "not sure"]
**Session context:** [one line about what the project was doing when this came up]
```

Keep it concrete. "The plan skill was confusing" is not useful.
"The plan skill's critique phase activated 4 perspectives when only 1
was relevant, adding 3 minutes of noise to every plan" is useful.

### 3. Surface for Confirmation

Include the draft in the debrief report under a distinct heading:

> **Upstream feedback for CoR:**
> I noticed friction with [component]. Here's what I'd send:
> [draft]
>
> Send this upstream? (yes / edit / skip)

The user confirms, edits, or dismisses. One quick decision per item.
Do not ask open-ended questions. Do not batch — if there are multiple
friction points (rare), present each separately.

### 4. Deliver

If the user confirms, deliver the feedback. Detection and delivery
follow the same pattern as `/extract`:

**If linked** (the CoR package resolves to a local directory — check
if `node -e "console.log(require.resolve('create-claude-rails'))"`
points to a local path rather than a `node_modules` path):

- Write the feedback as a markdown file in the CoR repo's `feedback/`
  directory (create it if needed)
- Filename: `[source-project]-[date]-[short-title].md`
  (e.g., `flow-2026-04-04-plan-critique-noise.md`)
- Add frontmatter: `type: field-feedback`, `source: [project]`,
  `date: [ISO date]`, `component: [skill/phase name]`

**If not linked** (CoR is installed from npm):

- Open a GitHub issue on the CoR repo
- Title: `Field feedback: [short title]`
- Label: `field-feedback` (create if needed)
- Body: the feedback markdown

**If neither works** (no link, no gh access):

- Output the feedback to the terminal and tell the user to file
  it manually or copy it to the CoR repo

### 5. Done

Note in the debrief report what was sent and where. Move on to the
next phase.
