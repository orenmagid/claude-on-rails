# Close Work — Match, Close, and Resolve

Define how to match the session's work against open items and close them.
This includes marking tasks done, resolving feedback, and updating any
tracking system. The /debrief skill reads this file after inventorying
what was done.

When this file is absent or empty, the default behavior is: query the
reference data layer (pib-db) for open actions, match against the
session's git log, and propose marking matched actions as done. If
pib-db is not initialized, skip gracefully.

## Default Behavior (pib-db)

When no custom close-work is configured:

1. **Get session work:** Review `git log --oneline` for this session's
   commits (since session start or last 2 hours)
2. **Get open actions:** `node scripts/pib-db.js list-actions`
3. **Match:** For each open action, check if this session's work
   addresses it (compare action text/notes against commit messages
   and changed files)
4. **Propose:** Present matched actions and ask the user to confirm
   which to close
5. **Close confirmed:** `node scripts/pib-db.js complete-action <fid>`

If pib-db doesn't exist, skip with a note.

## What to Include

- **How to query open items** — where your work tracker lives, how to
  read it
- **How to mark items done** — the command or API to update status
- **How to resolve feedback** — if your project tracks feedback or
  comments, how to mark them addressed
- **What to include in completion notes** — commit references, summary
  of what was built

## Example Close-Work Patterns

Uncomment and adapt these for your project:

<!--
### Task Tracker (Database)
```bash
# Query open tasks
sqlite3 project.db "SELECT id, text, status FROM tasks WHERE status != 'done'"

# Mark a task done with commit reference
COMMIT=$(git log -1 --format=%h)
sqlite3 project.db "UPDATE tasks SET status = 'done', notes = notes || '\n\nCompleted in $COMMIT' WHERE id = 'TASK_ID'"
```

### Task Tracker (API)
```bash
# Query open tasks
curl -s https://your-api.example.com/api/tasks?status=open

# Mark done
curl -X PATCH https://your-api.example.com/api/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "done", "completedRef": "COMMIT_HASH"}'
```

### Task Tracker (Markdown)
```bash
# Find open tasks
grep -n '- \[ \]' tasks.md

# Mark done (replace checkbox)
# Edit the file to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items
```

### Feedback / Comments
```bash
# Query unresolved feedback
sqlite3 project.db "SELECT id, text FROM feedback WHERE resolved = 0"

# Cross-reference against session work — if the feedback was addressed,
# resolve it with a note about what fixed it
sqlite3 project.db "UPDATE feedback SET resolved = 1, resolution = 'Fixed in COMMIT' WHERE id = FEEDBACK_ID"
```

### Follow-On Work
When closing an item that has documented sub-phases or next steps in its
notes, create new items for each. Known work that lives only in completed
items' notes will be forgotten. There is no "later" — create it now.
