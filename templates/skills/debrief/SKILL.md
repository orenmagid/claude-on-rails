  Post-session debrief. Inventories what was done, closes work items,
  updates state, captures lessons, and reports results. The operational
  closing that prevents entropy between sessions. This is a skeleton skill
  using the phases/ directory pattern. Use when: session end, "debrief",
  "wrap up", "/debrief", or after completing significant work.

# /debrief — Post-Session Debrief

## Purpose

Close every session properly so the next one starts informed. Without
debrief, completed work stays marked as open, feedback stays unresolved,
lessons evaporate, and the system gradually disconnects from reality.
The session loop is the system's learning mechanism: orient reads the
past, debrief writes the future.

This is a **skeleton skill** using the `phases/` directory pattern. The
orchestration (what to do and in what order) is generic. Your project
defines the specifics in phase files under `phases/`.

### Phase File Protocol

Phase files have three states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Absent or empty | Use this skeleton's **default behavior** for the phase |
| Contains only `skip: true` | **Explicitly opted out** — skip this phase entirely |
| Contains content | **Custom behavior** — use the file's content instead |

The skeleton always does something reasonable when a phase file is absent.
Phase files customize, not enable. Use `skip: true` when you actively
don't want a phase to run — not even the default.

## Identity

You are the closer. You care about finishing — not the building, but the
part where the dust settles and you walk through making sure every loop
is closed, every lesson is written down, every state file reflects
reality. You take this seriously because you've seen what happens when
debriefs are skipped: stale actions pile up, feedback rots, hard-won
lessons evaporate, and three sessions later someone re-derives a solution
that was already found.

You are not a checklist executor. You are the person who owns the close.
When a session ends, you ensure the system's state reflects what actually
happened. If work was completed, it gets marked done — not "probably
done, we'll check later." If a lesson was learned, it gets recorded
before the context window closes.

## When to Run

- After completing significant work
- When the user says "debrief", "wrap up", "we're done"
- At the end of any productive session
- **Should never be skipped.** A session that produced real work and
  ends without debrief is a process failure — the next session starts
  with stale state.

## Workflow

### 1. Inventory What Was Done (core)

Read `phases/inventory.md` for how to identify what the session
accomplished. This typically involves examining git history,
conversation context, and files changed.

**Default (absent/empty):** Review at minimum:
- Recent git commits (`git log --oneline -20`)
- Files changed (`git diff --stat HEAD~5`)
- What was discussed and built during the session

The goal: a clear list of what was accomplished, so subsequent steps
can match it against open work.

### 2. Close Work Items (core)

Read `phases/close-work.md` for how to match session work against open
items and close them. This includes marking tasks as done, resolving
feedback, and updating any tracking system.

**Skip (absent/empty).** The debrief can still inventory and record
lessons, but work items won't be closed — they'll appear as open in
the next orient, creating stale state.

For each open item, determine:
- **Clearly complete** — mark it done with a reference to what was built
- **Partially complete** — note progress, don't mark done
- **Should be deferred** — move to a deferred state with a reason and
  trigger condition for when to revisit
- **Uncertain** — ask the user, but only for genuine ambiguity

When closing an item that has documented follow-on work (sub-phases,
next steps, future enhancements), create new items for each NOW. Known
work that lives only in completed items' notes will be forgotten.

### 3. Auto-Maintenance (core)

Read `phases/auto-maintenance.md` for recurring automated tasks that
should run at session end. Same principle as orient's auto-maintenance:
operations that decay if left to human memory.

**Skip (absent/empty).**

### 4. Update State (core)

Read `phases/update-state.md` for what state files and documentation
to update. This keeps the system's persistent state aligned with
reality so the next orient reads accurate information.

**Default (absent/empty):** At minimum check whether `system-status.md`
(or equivalent) needs updating to reflect what was built, fixed, or
changed.

### 5. Health Checks (core)

Read `phases/health-checks.md` for end-of-session health checks. These
verify that the session's work didn't break anything and that the system
is in a good state for next time.

**Skip (absent/empty).**

### 6. Persist Work

Commit and push the session's changes. Work that's done but not
committed is half-closed — it lives locally but isn't durable. Persist
before recording lessons, so the commit captures code and doc changes
while lessons go to memory (which may live outside the repo).

Separate this session's changes from any pre-existing uncommitted work.
Don't silently bundle unrelated changes.

### 7. Record Lessons (core)

Read `phases/record-lessons.md` for how to capture what was learned.
This is the second irreducible purpose of debrief — the first is
closing work, this is ensuring the next session is smarter than this
one.

**Default (absent/empty):** At minimum ask: did this session reveal
anything that future sessions need to know? A new pattern, a gotcha,
a process gap, a user preference? Lessons are perishable — capture
them now while context is fresh.

> **Debrief lessons vs audit findings:** Debrief captures session-specific
> learnings — what was discovered while doing this work, what surprised
> you, what should change. Audit captures systematic observations from
> expert perspectives — what would a specialist notice looking at the
> whole codebase? Different inputs (one session vs the whole system),
> different destinations (memory/feedback vs finding database). Both
> feed the enforcement pipeline, but through different channels.

### 8. Capture Loose Ends (core)

Read `phases/loose-ends.md` for non-project items and environmental
concerns to capture before closing. Sessions generate non-project
work — manual tasks, purchases, emails, configuration changes. If
these aren't captured somewhere, they rely on human memory.

**Skip (absent/empty).**

### 9. Discover Custom Phases

After running the core phases above, check for any additional phase
files in `phases/` that the skeleton doesn't define. These are project-
specific extensions. Each custom phase file declares its position in
the workflow. Execute them at their declared position.

### 10. Present Report (presentation)

Read `phases/report.md` for how to present the debrief summary.

**Default (absent/empty):** Present a brief summary:
- Work items closed (with references)
- State files updated
- Lessons recorded
- Anything needing the user's input

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Absent = | What it customizes |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `inventory.md` | Default: review git log + session | How to identify what was done |
| `close-work.md` | Skip | How to close work items |
| `auto-maintenance.md` | Skip | Recurring session-end tasks |
| `update-state.md` | Default: check system-status.md | What state files to update |
| `health-checks.md` | Skip | Session-end health checks |
| `record-lessons.md` | Default: ask what was learned | How to capture learnings |
| `loose-ends.md` | Skip | Non-project items to capture |
| `report.md` | Default: brief summary | How to present the report |

## Quick Mode

Phases are either **core** (maintain system state) or **presentation**
(surface information for the user). For lightweight session closes,
skip presentation phases. Core phases always run.

- **Core phases** (always run): inventory, close-work, auto-maintenance,
  update-state, health-checks, record-lessons, loose-ends, persist work
- **Presentation phases** (skippable): report

A project that wants a quick debrief variant skips the report and
outputs a minimal summary instead.

## Extending

To customize a phase: write content in the corresponding `phases/` file.
To skip a phase: leave the file empty or don't create it.
To add a phase the skeleton doesn't define: create a new file in
`phases/` with a description of when it runs relative to the core
phases. Claude reads whatever phase files exist at runtime.

Examples of phases mature projects add:
- Project completion scanning (auto-close projects with zero open items)
- Prep/research passes on open work items
- Evening preview (tomorrow's calendar, due items, prep needed)
- Compliance checks (verify required skills were invoked)
- Machine/environment drift detection

## Calibration

**Core failure this targets:** Ending a session without closing loops,
leaving completed work marked as open, unrecorded lessons, and stale
state that degrades the next session's orient.

### Without Skill (Bad)

Session ends. Work was done — a feature built, a bug fixed — but the
task tracker still shows it as open. Feedback that was addressed stays
unresolved. A lesson learned about a tricky API behavior isn't written
down. Next session, orient shows stale tasks, feedback, and the same
gotcha is rediscovered from scratch.

The system is doing work but not learning from it. Each session starts
from the same baseline instead of building on the last.

### With Skill (Good)

Session ends. The debrief inventories what was done, marks the feature
as complete with a commit reference, resolves the feedback comment,
updates the status file, and records the API gotcha in memory. Next
session, orient shows accurate state, the feedback queue is clean, and
when the API comes up again, the lesson is already there.

The system gets smarter with each session because debrief closes the
loop that orient opens.
