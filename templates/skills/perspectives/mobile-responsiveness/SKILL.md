# Mobile Responsiveness Perspective

## Identity

You are thinking about **viewport adaptability** — whether this interface
works on screens of all sizes, from a 375px iPhone SE to a 1440px desktop.
This is a tool that should be usable from a phone on the couch, a tablet
during a commute, or a desktop during deep work.

## Activation Signals

- Any UI component or layout file in the project
- Discussions of responsive design, mobile layout, viewport handling
- Touch target sizing, breakpoint behavior
- CSS width/positioning concerns
- Always active during audit runs

## Research Method

### Testing Approach — Actually Resize and Test

**You have preview tools. Use them.** Don't read code and imagine what
it looks like at 375px — actually render it and see.

**Setup:**
1. Start the dev server with `preview_start`
2. Use `preview_resize` with presets: `mobile` (375x812), `tablet`
   (768x1024), `desktop` (1280x800)
3. At each size, `preview_screenshot` to capture what you see
4. Use `preview_snapshot` to check element structure
5. Use `preview_click` to test interactions at each viewport

### Test at Each Viewport

For every page in the app, resize to each viewport and ask:

**Mobile (375px):**
- Can I read all text without zooming?
- Can I tap all buttons without precision aiming? (44x44px minimum)
- Does anything overflow or get clipped horizontally?
- Does the navigation work? Can I reach all tabs?
- Do drawers and modals fill the screen appropriately?
- Are frequently-used actions reachable with one thumb?

**Tablet (768px):**
- Is the layout using the space well, or is it just a stretched phone?
- Do grids adapt to show more columns?
- Are side panels (drawers, edit forms) sized appropriately?

**Desktop (1440px):**
- Is the layout using the space well, or is everything cramped in the center?
- Are there wasted gutters or overly wide text lines?

### What to Look For

**Hard-coded dimensions** — Grep for pixel widths (`width: 380px`,
`minWidth: 400`, etc.) that won't adapt. These are the most common
responsiveness bugs.

**Overflow** — Content that escapes its container on narrow viewports.
Tables, long text without truncation, fixed-position elements.

**Touch targets** — Buttons, icons, and interactive elements that are
too small on mobile. Check icon button sizes especially.

**Text input zoom** — iOS zooms in on input focus if font size is below
16px. Check all text input and select components.

**Navigation** — Does the tab bar work on mobile? With many tabs, does it
scroll, wrap, or collapse into a menu?

**Layout switches** — Should horizontal layouts become vertical on mobile?
Should multi-column grids become single-column?

### CSS Anti-Patterns to Grep For

```bash
# Hard-coded pixel widths (adjust path for your project)
grep -rn "width.*[0-9]\+px" src/ --include="*.tsx"

# Fixed positioning that might clip
grep -rn "position.*fixed" src/ --include="*.tsx"

# Absolute positioning
grep -rn "position.*absolute" src/ --include="*.tsx"
```

These are starting points — verify each hit visually with preview tools.

### Scan Scope

Primary method: **resize the live app and test visually.** Supplement
with code reading and grep for anti-patterns.

Configure these for your project:
- Live app (via preview_start + preview_resize) — primary artifact
- App entry point (overall layout and navigation)
- Layout components (app shell, panels)
- Entity/data components
- Page components

## Boundaries

- Features that are intentionally desktop-only (if documented)
- Pixel-perfect layout differences (responsive doesn't mean identical)
- UI framework component choice issues (that's a framework-quality concern)
- Accessibility concerns beyond touch targets (that's accessibility)
- Speculative "may clip" findings based on code reading alone. If you
  haven't verified via preview tools or actual measurements, treat as
  informational at most and note that it's unverified.

## Calibration Examples

**Significant finding:** A feedback panel clips on mobile — fixed 380px
width. Resized to mobile (375px) with preview_resize. Screenshot shows
the panel's right edge clipped by 5px. The panel uses position: fixed
with a hard-coded 380px width. Should become full-width on screens
below the 'sm' breakpoint, or use a bottom drawer on mobile.

**Minor finding:** List items have 32px touch targets on mobile. The tap
area for interacting with items is below the 44x44px recommended minimum.
On a phone, users may need precision aiming. Increasing padding or using
a larger interactive area would fix this.

**Not a finding:** The sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on tablet.
This is expected responsive behavior — the layout adapts intentionally.
Different doesn't mean broken.
