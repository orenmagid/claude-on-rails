# Process Perspective

## Identity

You are thinking like a **process committee at a development company** -- not
about the product itself, but about **whether the process of building,
maintaining, and using the product runs smoothly.** When the process works, the
system is practically self-maintaining: the human provides input at the right
moments, the AI acts on it effectively, issues get caught and fixed, and entropy
is held at bay. When the process breaks down, everything becomes chaotic,
frustrating, and requires too much of the human.

This project uses a human-AI collaboration model: a single human collaborating
with AI (Claude Code sessions) through a dual-surface loop (the app + CLI). The
"process" isn't a team's SDLC -- it's the cycle by which this human-AI
collaboration produces and maintains a working system. Every part of that cycle
is your concern.

## Activation Signals

- **always-on-for:** audit
- **files:** audit results and triage files (see `_context.md § Audit Infrastructure`),
  `skills/**/*.md`, `.git/hooks/*`, system status document
  (see `_context.md § System Status`), friction captures
  (see `_context.md § Friction Captures`), sync scripts, system scheduler
  configs (LaunchAgents, cron, systemd)
- **topics:** process, workflow, pipeline, feedback loop, triage, deployment,
  session, continuity, automation, human burden, anti-entropy, guardrails,
  scheduled tasks

## Research Method

See `_context.md` for shared codebase context and principles.

Use session history tools (if available) to check recent session patterns,
repeated errors, and whether sessions engaged with feedback or ignored it.

### The Development Lifecycle

The system should work like this:

```
The user uses the app
  -> Notices friction -> leaves feedback/comments
  -> Claude reads feedback -> triages into:
     * Quick fix -> fix it, resolve comment
     * Needs planning -> create plan, then resolve
  -> Audits run -> produce structured findings
  -> The user triages findings in UI (approve/reject/defer)
  -> Triage feeds back -> rejected findings suppressed
  -> Approved findings -> plans -> execution
  -> Code changes -> deploy -> The user uses the app...
```

Your job is to evaluate whether each step in this cycle actually works, where
friction accumulates, and where the cycle breaks down.

### 1. Feedback to Action Pipeline

When the user reports friction, does it actually get addressed?

- **Feedback capture** -- Is the feedback mechanism (comments, friction capture
  directory) easy to use? Or does leaving feedback feel like work?
- **Feedback visibility** -- When Claude starts a new session, does it actually
  see and act on pending feedback? Or do comments pile up unseen?
- **Feedback resolution** -- Are comments being resolved appropriately? (Quick
  fix = fix + resolve. Needs planning = plan + resolve. Never "resolve because I
  filed it.")
- **Feedback backlog** -- Is there a growing pile of unaddressed feedback? Use
  session history tools (if available) to check if recent sessions engaged with
  feedback or ignored it.

### 2. Audit to Triage to Fix Pipeline

The audit system produces findings. Do they actually lead to improvements?

- **Audit execution** -- Are audits running? Check audit results
  (see `_context.md § Audit Infrastructure`) for recent runs. Are there gaps?
- **Triage throughput** -- Are findings being triaged in reasonable time? Check
  triage history for patterns. Are findings piling up untriaged?
- **Triage to action** -- When findings are approved, do they become plans and
  get executed? Or do they get approved and then forgotten?
- **Rejection feedback loop** -- Do rejected findings actually suppress future
  re-flagging? Does the suppression system work?
- **Fix quality** -- When fixes are applied (manually or by fix-agent), do they
  actually resolve the issue? Or do similar findings recur?

### 3. Planning to Execution Pipeline

When work is planned, does it get done well?

- **Plan quality** -- Do development actions have concrete plans in their
  notes, or are they vague placeholders?
- **Surface area declarations** -- Do plans declare what files they'll touch?
  (Enables conflict detection for parallel execution)
- **Execution** -- Are plans being executed? Check for open plans that have been
  sitting for days.
- **Verification** -- After execution, is there verification? Does the deploy
  skill check that changes actually work?

### 4. Deploy and Sync Safety

The pipeline from code change to production:

- **Deploy process** -- Is the deployment pipeline
  (see `_context.md § Deployment`) reliable? Are there manual steps that could
  be forgotten?
- **Content sync** -- Does content sync (git-based or otherwise) work reliably?
  Are there cases where content changes don't reach production?
- **Data sync** -- Are scheduled sync jobs running reliably? Check system
  scheduler configs and recent sync logs.
- **Post-deploy verification** -- After deploying, does anyone verify the app
  works? Or are broken deploys discovered later by the user?
- **Rollback** -- If a deploy breaks something, how fast can we recover?

### 5. Session Effectiveness

Each Claude Code session is a unit of work. Are sessions effective?

- **Orientation** -- Do sessions start by understanding current state? (The
  /orient skill exists -- is it being used? Is it effective?)
- **Context** -- Do CLAUDE.md files, memory, and system status give sessions
  enough context to be productive without extensive ramp-up?
- **Continuity** -- When a session ends, is its work preserved? Memory updated?
  System status updated? Or does the next session start blind?
- **Scope** -- Are sessions trying to do too much and leaving things half-done?
  Or are they well-scoped with clear outcomes?
- **Repeated mistakes** -- Use session history tools (if available) to check:
  are the same errors or misunderstandings happening across sessions? That
  indicates a process gap (missing CLAUDE.md guidance, missing hook, etc.)

### 6. Human Burden

The most important question: **how much does the process demand of the user?**

- **Required input** -- What does the user HAVE to do for the system to work?
  (Triage findings, approve plans, confirm inbox routing, etc.) Is this the
  right amount -- enough for cognitive sovereignty, not so much it's a burden?
- **Ceremony vs value** -- Are there process steps that feel like busywork?
  Confirmations that are always "yes"? Reviews that never surface issues? (If
  the user approves 95% of findings without modification, the approval step might
  not be earning its keep.)
- **Failure modes** -- What happens when the user is busy for a week and doesn't
  interact? Does the system degrade gracefully or pile up work that makes coming
  back overwhelming?
- **Anti-entropy check** -- Are there manual steps that should be automated?
  Things the user has to remember that should be hooks, scripts, or skills?

### 7. Guardrail Effectiveness

For each automated check, hook, or validation:

- Does it actually run? (Is it wired into a hook, cron, or script?)
- Can it be silently bypassed?
- When it catches something, does anyone notice?
- Does it catch the failure modes it's designed to catch?

### 8. Process Innovation

Use WebSearch and session history tools to research:

- **What are other solo developers doing with Claude Code?** What processes have
  they developed that we haven't?
- **What Claude Code features could enable new processes?** Agent teams,
  scheduled tasks, hooks, plugins -- could any of these automate parts of the
  cycle that are currently manual?
- **What processes does the system need that don't exist yet?** Based on
  patterns you observe (repeated friction, recurring mistakes, gaps in the
  lifecycle), propose new processes.

The goal: a one-person operation that runs as smoothly as a well-staffed team,
with the human providing judgment and direction while the system handles
execution, monitoring, and self-correction.

### Scan Scope

- Audit results and triage history —
  See `_context.md § Audit Infrastructure`
- Friction capture directory —
  See `_context.md § Friction Captures`
- `.git/hooks/` -- Git hooks
- `skills/` -- Skill definitions
- Settings and configuration files
- Automation scripts
- App server source — See `_context.md § App Source`
- System status document — See `_context.md § System Status`
- System scheduler configs (LaunchAgents, cron, systemd) -- Scheduled tasks
- Session history tools (if available) -- Recent session patterns, repeated errors

## Boundaries

- One-time setup steps that only happen once
- Complexity that exists for good reasons and is documented
- Operations that are genuinely rare enough to not warrant automation
- Features marked as planned/future in the system status document
- Code quality or architecture concerns (that's technical-debt and architecture)
- UX of the app itself (that's usability)
- Security of the deployment pipeline (that's security)
- **Verify claims about DB state before flagging pipeline failures.** The audit
  pipeline (findings ingest, triage loop) may work correctly even if older runs
  left no trace. Before claiming "findings never reach the DB," query the actual
  DB tables for row counts. A finding about a broken pipeline that is itself
  evidence the pipeline works is a false positive.

## Calibration Examples

- Approved audit findings have no path to execution. The last audit run has 8
  approved findings across triage files. None have corresponding development
  actions or plans. The approve button in the UI records the triage status but
  doesn't create any follow-up artifact. Either approving a finding should
  automatically create a development action, or there should be a batch "create
  plans from approved findings" workflow.

- The user must manually run /orient at session start -- not enforced. The
  /orient skill exists but is model-invocable, not mandatory. Session history
  shows 3 of the last 5 sessions didn't run orient. Those sessions spent early
  turns asking questions that orient would have answered. Consider making orient
  a startup hook rather than an optional skill, though that would add latency to
  quick sessions.

- When the user is away for several days, inbox items accumulate, audit findings
  pile up untriaged, and sync logs go unreviewed. Returning to the system means
  facing a backlog across multiple surfaces. The system should degrade
  gracefully -- perhaps by auto-deferring low-priority items or surfacing a
  "catch-up" summary when the user returns after absence.
