# Detect State — Scan Claude on Rails Artifacts and Determine Mode

Scan the project for existing CoR artifacts to determine whether this is
a first run, early re-run, or mature re-run. The mode determination
drives how every subsequent phase behaves.

When this file is absent or empty, the default behavior is: scan for the
standard CoR artifact set, classify each artifact's richness, and
determine the mode. To explicitly skip state detection (force first-run
mode), write only `skip: true`.

## Fast Path

Check for `_context.md` (or `.claude/skills/perspectives/_context.md`).
If it doesn't exist, the mode is **first-run** — skip the full scan and
move to the interview immediately. No need to check 10 artifact types
when the primary signal is absent.

Also read `.pibrc.json` if it exists — it records which modules the CLI
installed and which were skipped (with reasons). The interview phase uses
this to skip redundant questions.

## Full Scan (re-runs only)

Only when `_context.md` exists, scan these artifacts to distinguish
early vs mature re-run:

| Artifact | Path Pattern | Indicates |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| System status | `system-status.md` | State tracking exists |
| Orient phases | `.claude/skills/orient/phases/*.md` | Session loop is wired |
| Debrief phases | `.claude/skills/debrief/phases/*.md` | Session loop is wired |
| Work tracking DB | `pib.db` | Work tracking is active |
| Perspective groups | `_groups.yaml` or `.claude/skills/perspectives/_groups.yaml` | Audit system configured |
| Memory patterns | `memory/patterns/*.md` or `.claude/memory/patterns/*.md` | Feedback loop is active |
| CLAUDE.md | Root `CLAUDE.md` | Project instructions exist |
| Rules files | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Scoped instructions exist |
| Hook config | `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json` | Enforcement hooks exist |

**Early re-run:** Fewer than 5 of the above are populated.
**Mature re-run:** 5 or more are populated.

## Output

For first-run: `Mode: first-run` — that's it. Move on.

For re-runs, report a structured summary that subsequent phases can
reference:

```
Mode: early-rerun | mature-rerun

Artifacts found:
  - system-status.md: populated
  - orient phases: 3 files (context.md, work-scan.md, health-checks.md)
  - pib.db: absent
  - memory patterns: 4 files
  ...

Summary: Early re-run. Session loop is wired but work tracking and
audit are not yet active. Context layer is 3 weeks old.
```

This summary is not presented to the user directly — it feeds into the
interview phase so questions can be targeted. The user sees the mode
reflected in the questions they're asked, not as a diagnostic report.
