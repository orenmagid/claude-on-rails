# Interview — Conversational Questions Adapted to Mode

The heart of onboarding. This is a dialogue, not a form — ask questions,
listen to answers, follow up on what's interesting or unclear. The quality
of the context layer depends directly on the quality of this conversation.

When this file is absent or empty, the default behavior is: ask mode-
adapted questions as described below, 2-3 at a time, with follow-ups.
To explicitly skip the interview (e.g., when generating context from
existing documentation), write only `skip: true`.

## System Introduction (First Run Only)

Before asking about the project, check: does the user know what Claude
on Rails does? Ask once:

> "Have you used Claude on Rails before, or is this your first time?"

If **first time**, give a brief walkthrough before the interview:

> "Let me explain how this works, then we'll set it up for your project.
>
> Claude on Rails gives your Claude Code sessions a **session loop** —
> a start and end routine that creates continuity between sessions.
>
> - **`/orient`** runs at the start. It reads where things stand — what
>   you were working on, what's due, what broke. Instead of starting
>   blind, Claude starts informed.
> - **`/debrief`** runs at the end. It records what happened — what got
>   done, what's still open, what you learned. That's what orient reads
>   next time.
>
> Beyond the session loop, there are optional modules: **work tracking**
> (a local task database), **planning** (structured plans with critique
> before you build), **audit** (expert perspectives that review your
> codebase), and more. We'll get to those after we talk about your project.
>
> The whole system is customizable through small files called phase files.
> You don't need to touch them now — that's what this onboarding does."

Then proceed to the interview. Keep it conversational — if they ask
questions about the system, answer them before moving on.

If **experienced** (they've used it before, or say "I know how it works"),
skip the walkthrough entirely and go straight to the interview.

## Communication Calibration

Don't ask the user how technical they are. Listen to how they talk.
Within the first 2-3 answers, you'll know whether they reference
technical concepts naturally or describe things in terms of outcomes.
Match their register — mirror their vocabulary, explain at the level
they're engaging at. Don't talk down, don't talk over.

This isn't a variable to detect ("technical_level: 3"). It's a
conversational stance: meet people where they are. Someone who says
"I need a REST API with PostgreSQL" gets different follow-ups than
someone who says "I need a way to track client appointments." Both
are valid starting points.

## First-Run Questions

The detect-state phase identified this as a first run (no CoR context
layer exists). But "first run" covers two very different situations:

### Greenfield (no project yet, or near-empty directory)

The user just ran the CLI in an empty or near-empty directory. There's
nothing to scan, no workflow to reflect on yet. Questions must be
**forward-looking** — about intentions, not retrospection.

**Round 1 — What and why:**
- What are you trying to build?
- What will you be using Claude Code for on this project?

**Round 2 — How you work (adapt based on Round 1):**
- How do you usually keep track of what needs to be done? (A list
  somewhere, a tool, your head?)
- Will anyone else be working on this with you?
- Have you struggled with anything on past projects that you'd want
  to get ahead of this time?

**Round 3 — Scope and shape (adapt based on Rounds 1-2):**
- How big is this? A weekend project, something you'll be working on
  for months?
- What does done look like, roughly?

**Follow-up instincts:**
- If they describe something ambitious, ask what the first milestone is
- If they mention past frustrations, dig into what specifically went wrong
- If they're vague about the project, that's fine — they may be figuring
  it out. Ask what they know so far and what's still open
- If they mention collaborators, ask how they'll coordinate

### Existing Project (source files, config, or meaningful content present)

The user ran the CLI in a project that already has substance. There are
files to scan — use them for tech detection instead of asking. Focus the
conversation on **work and pain**, not tooling.

**Before Round 1:** Scan the project for tech signals (package.json,
Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, .github/, etc.). Note what
you find — it informs your follow-ups but doesn't replace the
conversation. Don't announce what you found; weave it in naturally.

**Round 1 — Identity:**
- Tell me about this project. What does it do, who is it for?
- What are you mainly working on right now?

**Round 2 — Pain (adapt based on Round 1):**
- What tends to break or get forgotten?
- What do you wish Claude knew about this project from the very start
  of every session?
- Is there anything that fails silently — things that go wrong without
  anyone noticing until it's too late?

**Round 3 — Operations (adapt based on Rounds 1-2):**
- How do you currently keep track of what needs to be done?
- What does a typical working session on this project look like?
- Is there a deploy pipeline or remote environment?

**Follow-up instincts:**
- If someone mentions a pain point, ask *why* it happens and how often
- If someone says "it's just me," ask how they keep context between sessions
- If someone mentions a team, ask about handoff friction
- If someone describes their workflow, listen for things that could be
  automated or checked

## Early Re-Run Questions

The session loop has been running. Shift from "what is this" to "what
have you learned."

**Round 1 — Session Loop Feedback:**
- What has the session loop taught you that the context files don't
  currently capture?
- Does orient give you what you need at session start? What's missing?
- Does debrief close the right loops? What falls through?

**Round 2 — Friction (adapt based on Round 1):**
- Where have you hit friction with the current setup?
- Are there things you keep having to tell Claude that should already be
  in the context?
- Any phase files that aren't pulling their weight?

**Round 3 — Growth (adapt based on Rounds 1-2):**
- Has the project changed since the initial onboard? New components,
  shifted priorities, different pain points?
- Are you ready for any of the modules you skipped last time?
- Anything you've been doing manually that should be automated?

## Mature Re-Run Questions

The system has been running long enough to accumulate both value and
cruft. This is a health check.

**Round 1 — Usage Reality:**
- Which modules are you actually using regularly?
- Anything that felt useful at first but you've stopped relying on?
- Are there modules you adopted but never really configured properly?

**Round 2 — Gaps and Drift:**
- What gaps have you noticed in coverage? Things the system should catch
  but doesn't.
- Has the project's architecture or priorities shifted since the last
  onboard run? Does the context layer reflect the current reality?
- Any new pain points that weren't there before?

**Round 3 — Simplification:**
- Is anything ready to retire? Phase files, perspectives, health checks
  that check for problems you no longer have?
- Could any of your custom phase files be simplified now that you know
  what you actually need?
- Are there patterns in your memory/feedback that suggest a structural
  change rather than another rule?

## Conversation Guidelines

- **2-3 questions per round.** Let the user respond before asking more.
- **Follow up on substance.** If an answer reveals something important,
  dig into it before moving on to the next topic.
- **Note CoR module signals.** When someone describes a pain point that
  maps to a specific module, note it internally for the modularity menu
  phase — but don't interrupt the conversation to pitch the module.
- **Don't assume answers.** Even if you can see the project's files, ask
  about things like pain points and priorities that only the user knows.
- **Summarize before generating.** After the interview, reflect back what
  you heard: "Here's what I'm taking away from this conversation..." Let
  the user correct before generating files.
- **For skipped modules (.pibrc.json):** If the CLI's `skipped` field
  shows a module was opted out with a reason, weave that into the
  conversation naturally. "I see you're tracking work somewhere else —
  tell me about that" rather than "Module work-tracking was skipped."
