# CoR Upstream Guard — PreToolUse hook for Edit and Write tool calls
#
# Blocks modifications to files managed by Claude on Rails. These files
# are upstream-owned: updates come through /cor-upgrade, not direct edits.
# Project-specific customization goes in _context.md and phase files.
#
# How it works:
#   Reads .corrc.json manifest (list of CoR-installed files with hashes).
#   If the target file_path is in the manifest, block the write.
#
# ROLLBACK: Comment out the PreToolUse entry for this hook in
# .claude/settings.json to disable it immediately.
#
# Hook contract:
#   Input: $CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT has the tool use JSON with "file_path" field
#   Output: JSON on stdout with { "decision": "block"|"allow", "reason": "..." }

# Extract file_path from tool input
FILE_PATH=$(echo "$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('file_path',''))" 2>/dev/null)
