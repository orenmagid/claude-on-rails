# Claude Cabinet — Full Restructure Plan

## What This Is

A complete rename and restructure of the project formerly known as
"Claude on Rails" (`create-claude-rails`) into **Claude Cabinet**
(`create-claude-cabinet`). This is not just a terminology pass — it's a
full commitment to the cabinet metaphor at every layer: package name,
directory structure, file names, frontmatter keys, prose, and CLI output.

This document is the single source of truth for the restructure. Every
file affected, every term changed, every risk identified, and the full
Flow migration plan are here.

---

## Part 1: Terminology Map (locked in)

### Concept Renames

| Old Term | New Term | Where It Appears |
|---|---|---|
| Claude on Rails | **Claude Cabinet** | project name everywhere |
| create-claude-rails | **create-claude-cabinet** | npm package, CLI, bin/, docs |
| CoR | **CC** (or spell out) | abbreviation in code/docs — evaluate case by case |
| perspective | **cabinet member** | 86 files, ~1,375 line occurrences |
| group | **committee** | 15 files, ~57 occurrences |
| `_groups.yaml` | **`committees.yaml`** | 15 files referencing it |
| context file / `_context-*.md` | **briefing / `_briefing-*.md`** | 52 files, ~389 occurrences |
| scan scope | **paths** (within briefings) | briefing templates |
| lane | **portfolio** | 11 files, ~37 occurrences |
| cross-cutting | **cross-portfolio mandate** | 5 files, ~12 occurrences |
| activation signals | **convening criteria** | 8 files, ~21 occurrences |
| always-on-for | **standing-mandate** | 25 files, ~56 occurrences |
| `perspective-*` (name prefix) | **`cabinet-*`** | all 20 member SKILL.md frontmatter |
| `skills/perspectives/` | **members → `skills/cabinet-*/`, infra → `cabinet/`** | directory paths everywhere |

### Cabinet Member Name Renames

| Old Directory Name | New Directory Name | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| boundary-conditions | **boundary-man** | personality — edge case superhero |
| meta-process | **process-therapist** | diagnoses whether the process is healthy |
| mobile-responsiveness | **small-screen** | shorter, still clear |
| skills-coverage | **roster-check** | fits cabinet metaphor — "is the roster complete?" |
| documentation | **record-keeper** | pairs with historian |
| process | **workflow-cop** | enforces process compliance — "process" alone is vague |
| performance | **speed-freak** | personality |

### Names That Stay

accessibility, anti-confirmation, architecture, cor-health, data-integrity,
debugger, historian, organized-mind, qa, security, system-advocate,
technical-debt, usability — already clear or evocative.

### "cor-" Prefix Decision

The `cor-` prefix appears in: `cor-health`, `cor-upgrade`, `cor-upstream-guard.sh`,
`cor-drift-check.cjs`, `.corrc.json`. These are **internal infrastructure names**,
not user-facing brand. Decision: **leave as-is for now**. The abbreviation still
works ("cabinet" → same first letter). Revisiting later is low-cost since these
are few files with grep-friendly names.

---

## Part 2: Directory Structure

### Constraint: Claude Code Discoverability

Claude Code discovers skills **only** at `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (plus
personal `~/.claude/skills/` and plugin paths). There is no way to register
additional discovery paths. Cabinet members **must** stay under `.claude/skills/`
to be discoverable. The metaphor lives in naming and frontmatter, not directory
depth.

Each needs: frontmatter name prefix change, context→briefing refs,
"Activation Signals"→"Convening Criteria", "always-on-for"→"standing-mandate",
"Boundaries"→"Portfolio", "lane"→"portfolio", "cross-cutting"→"cross-portfolio",
"Wrong lane:"→"Wrong portfolio:", plus contextual prose changes.

Full list:
- `cabinet-accessibility/SKILL.md` (was `perspectives/accessibility/`)
- `cabinet-anti-confirmation/SKILL.md`

- `cabinet/lifecycle.md`
- `cabinet/composition-patterns.md`
- `cabinet/eval-protocol.md`
- `cabinet/prompt-guide.md`
- `cabinet/output-contract.md`

**Workflow skills referencing perspectives (20+ files):**
- `audit/SKILL.md` — heaviest (references perspectives dozens of times)
- `audit/phases/perspective-selection.md` → **rename to** `member-selection.md`
- `audit/phases/perspective-execution.md` → **rename to** `member-execution.md`
- `audit/phases/structural-checks.md` — if it references perspectives
- `audit/phases/finding-output.md` — if it references perspectives
- `plan/SKILL.md`
- `plan/phases/perspective-critique.md` → **rename to** `cabinet-critique.md`
- `execute/SKILL.md`
- `execute/phases/perspectives.md` → **rename to** `cabinet.md`

- `seed/SKILL.md`
- `seed/phases/scan-signals.md`
- `seed/phases/build-perspective.md` → **rename to** `build-member.md`
- `seed/phases/evaluate-existing.md`
- `seed/phases/maintain.md`
- `onboard/SKILL.md`
- `onboard/phases/detect-state.md`
- `onboard/phases/generate-context.md`
- `onboard/phases/post-onboard-audit.md`
- `onboard/phases/modularity-menu.md`

- `triage-audit/SKILL.md`
- `triage-audit/phases/*.md`
- `pulse/SKILL.md`
- `validate/SKILL.md`
- `investigate/SKILL.md`

**Briefing templates (7 files):**
- `briefing/_briefing-template.md`
- `briefing/_briefing-identity-template.md`
- `briefing/_briefing-architecture-template.md`
- `briefing/_briefing-scopes-template.md`
- `briefing/_briefing-cabinet-template.md`

**Scripts:**
- `templates/scripts/merge-findings.js` — if it references perspectives
- `templates/scripts/cor-drift-check.cjs` — if it references perspectives

### 3C: Phase File Renames (7 files)

These phase files have "perspective" in their filename:

| Old Path | New Path |
|---|---|
| `audit/phases/perspective-selection.md` | `audit/phases/member-selection.md` |
| `audit/phases/perspective-execution.md` | `audit/phases/member-execution.md` |
| `plan/phases/perspective-critique.md` | `plan/phases/cabinet-critique.md` |
| `execute/phases/perspectives.md` | `execute/phases/cabinet.md` |
| `orient/phases/perspectives.md` | `orient/phases/cabinet.md` |
| `seed/phases/build-perspective.md` | `seed/phases/build-member.md` |
| `onboard/phases/generate-context.md` | `onboard/phases/generate-briefing.md` |

**Critical:** Each parent SKILL.md lists its phase files. When a phase file
is renamed, the parent SKILL.md frontmatter must be updated to match, AND
any other file that references the phase by name must be updated.

### 3D: Frontmatter Key Changes (25 files)

In every cabinet member SKILL.md:
```yaml
# Before
name: perspective-security
context:
  - _context-identity.md
  - _context-architecture.md
always-on-for: audit

# After
name: cabinet-security
briefing:
  - _briefing-identity.md
  - _briefing-architecture.md
standing-mandate: audit
```

Note: the frontmatter key `context:` → `briefing:` and `always-on-for:` →
`standing-mandate:`. Every piece of code that **reads** these frontmatter keys
must be updated: `audit/SKILL.md`, `audit/phases/member-execution.md`,
`execute/SKILL.md`, `execute/phases/cabinet.md`, `plan/SKILL.md`, `seed/SKILL.md`.

---

## Part 4: Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Template Directory Restructure

```

**Rename phase files** (7 files):
```bash
audit/phases/perspective-selection.md → audit/phases/member-selection.md
audit/phases/perspective-execution.md → audit/phases/member-execution.md
plan/phases/perspective-critique.md   → plan/phases/cabinet-critique.md

```

**Rename bin file:**
```bash
bin/create-claude-rails.js → bin/create-claude-cabinet.js
```

**Delete empty directory:**
```bash
rm -rf templates/skills/perspectives/  # should be empty after moves
```

### Phase 2: Content Updates — Cabinet Members (20 files)

For each of the 20 cabinet member SKILL.md files, apply these changes:

1. **Frontmatter:**
   - `name: perspective-X` → `name: cabinet-X`
   - `context:` key → `briefing:`
   - Each `_context-*.md` value → `_briefing-*.md`
   - `always-on-for:` → `standing-mandate:`
   - `user-invocable: false` stays

2. **Section headings:**
   - "Activation Signals" → "Convening Criteria"
   - "Boundaries" → "Portfolio Boundaries"

3. **Body text (contextual — not blind find/replace):**
   - "perspective" → "cabinet member" (when referring to the concept)
   - "perspectives" → "cabinet members" (plural)
   - "this perspective" → "this cabinet member"
   - "lane" → "portfolio" (when referring to domain boundaries)
   - "stays in its lane" → "stays in its portfolio"
   - "Wrong lane:" → "Wrong portfolio:"
   - "cross-cutting" → "cross-portfolio"

4. **For renamed members, also update internal identity references:**
   - boundary-conditions → boundary-man (in its own prose)
   - meta-process → process-therapist
   - mobile-responsiveness → small-screen
   - skills-coverage → roster-check
   - documentation → record-keeper
   - process → workflow-cop
   - performance → speed-freak

### Phase 3: Content Updates — Cabinet Infrastructure (6 files)

- **`committees-template.yaml`**: "groups"→"committees", "cross-cutting"→"cross-portfolio",
  all perspective names updated to new names
- **`lifecycle.md`**: full terminology pass — "perspective"→"cabinet member",
  "lane"→"portfolio", "cross-cutting"→"cross-portfolio", "activation signals"→
  "convening criteria", "always-on-for"→"standing-mandate", "_groups.yaml"→
  "committees.yaml", all perspective names, paths updated
- **`composition-patterns.md`**: "perspective"→"cabinet member" throughout,
  recipe names if they reference perspectives
- **`eval-protocol.md`**: "perspective"→"cabinet member", "lane"→"portfolio"
- **`prompt-guide.md`**: full terminology pass
- **`output-contract.md`**: "perspective"→"cabinet member"

### Phase 4: Content Updates — Workflow Skills (~30 files)

**audit/ (heaviest — most perspective references):**
- `SKILL.md` — rewrite all perspective refs, update paths to `skills/cabinet-*`,
  `_groups.yaml`→`committees.yaml`, update frontmatter listing phase files
  (renamed phases), `activation signals`→`convening criteria`
- `phases/member-selection.md` (renamed) — update content
- `phases/member-execution.md` (renamed) — update content, context loading
  instructions now reference `briefing/` directory
- Other phase files — check for perspective references

**plan/:**
- `SKILL.md` — perspective refs, activation signals
- `phases/cabinet-critique.md` (renamed) — update content

**execute/:**
- `SKILL.md` — perspective refs, activation signals, convening criteria
- `phases/cabinet.md` (renamed) — update content

**orient/:**
- `SKILL.md` — perspective refs
- `phases/cabinet.md` (renamed) — update content

**debrief/:**
- `SKILL.md` — "Perspective Check"→"Cabinet Check", all perspective refs,
  `_groups.yaml`→`committees.yaml`

**seed/:**
- `SKILL.md` — heavy rewrite (it builds perspectives), `_groups.yaml`→
  `committees.yaml`, all perspective/lane terminology
- `phases/build-member.md` (renamed) — update content
- `phases/scan-signals.md` — update terminology
- `phases/evaluate-existing.md` — update terminology
- `phases/maintain.md` — update terminology

**onboard/:**
- `SKILL.md` — perspective refs
- `phases/detect-state.md` — scanning for perspectives→cabinet members
- `phases/generate-briefing.md` (renamed) — context→briefing refs throughout
- `phases/post-onboard-audit.md` — `_groups.yaml`→`committees.yaml`
- `phases/modularity-menu.md` — perspective refs
- `phases/interview.md` — package name

**Other skills:** menu, cor-upgrade, triage-audit, pulse, validate, investigate,
link, unlink, publish, extract, debrief-quick, orient-quick — check each for
perspective/context/package name references and update.

### Phase 5: Content Updates — Briefing Templates (7 files)

- `_briefing-template.md` — rename all `_context-*` references to `_briefing-*`,
  "perspective"→"cabinet member", "context file"→"briefing"
- `_briefing-identity-template.md` — update cross-references
- `_briefing-architecture-template.md` — update cross-references
- `_briefing-scopes-template.md` — "scan scopes" language → "paths"

  "lanes"→"portfolios", "_groups.yaml"→"committees.yaml"
- `_briefing-work-tracking-template.md` — update cross-references
- `_briefing-api-template.md` — update cross-references

### Phase 6: Package Rename & Installer Updates

**`package.json`:**
- `"name": "create-claude-rails"` → `"name": "create-claude-cabinet"`
- `"bin"` entry: update path to `bin/create-claude-cabinet.js`
- `"repository"`, `"homepage"`, `"bugs"` URLs — update if repo renames
- `"description"` — update to reference cabinet

**`package-lock.json`:**
- Regenerate after package.json changes (`npm install`)

**`bin/create-claude-cabinet.js`** (renamed file):
- Update internal references if any

**`lib/cli.js` (19+ occurrences):**
- Banner/title text
- Help output
- MODULES object:
  - Module formerly called "perspectives" or "audit" — update descriptions
  - Template paths: `skills/perspectives/` → `skills/cabinet-*` + `cabinet/` + `briefing/`
  - Add new template directories to copying logic
- Error messages and user-facing strings
- Registry references

**`lib/metadata.js`:**
- Package name reference

**`lib/reset.js`:**
- Package name reference

**`lib/copy.js`:**

```

**Commit:** Single atomic commit. Message:
```
Rename to Claude Cabinet — full restructure

Commit the cabinet metaphor through every layer: package name
(create-claude-cabinet), directory structure (cabinet members in
skills/cabinet-*, infrastructure in cabinet/, briefings in briefing/),
and all terminology (perspective→cabinet member, group→committee,
lane→portfolio, activation signals→convening criteria).

Also rename 7 cabinet members for personality: boundary-man,
process-therapist, small-screen, roster-check, record-keeper,
workflow-cop, speed-freak.

Breaking change: all template paths changed. Existing installs
need cor-upgrade or fresh install.
```

## Part 5: Flow Migration Plan (Updated Post-Restructure)

Flow is the first (and currently only) downstream consumer. It has 32
perspectives (20 CoR standard + 12 Flow-custom), extensively customized
phase files, and a live production system. Migration must be careful.

**Status:** The upstream restructure is complete. This plan reflects the
actual changes that were made (not the original proposal).

### 5A: Flow's Current State

**CoR version installed:** 0.5.1
**Total perspectives deployed:** 32
- 20 CoR standard perspectives (old names)
- 12 Flow-custom: life-tracker, prep-scout, life-optimization,
  philosophical-grounding, mantine-quality, information-design,
  ui-experimentalist, goal-alignment, vision, gtd, sync-health,
  system-tutor (renamed to user-advocate later)

**Custom phase files (Flow-owned, not CoR-managed):**
- `orient/phases/perspectives.md` — activates specific perspectives per session
- `debrief/phases/upstream-feedback.md` — friction surfacing
- `plan/phases/perspective-critique.md` — may have custom content
- `execute/phases/perspectives.md` — may have custom content
- Plus ~40 other custom phase files across skills

**Key infrastructure files:**
- `.claude/skills/perspectives/_context.md` — monolithic context (15.6KB, heavily customized)
- `.claude/skills/perspectives/_groups.yaml` — 6 groups + cross-cutting
- `.corrc.json` — manifest tracking 90 upstream files with hashes

**Hooks:**
- `cor-upstream-guard.sh` reads `.corrc.json` to block upstream file edits

### 5B: What Actually Changed in the Restructure

**Package rename:**
- `create-claude-rails` → `create-claude-cabinet` (npm)
- Version: 0.6.0

**7 cabinet member renames:**
```
boundary-conditions → cabinet-boundary-man
meta-process        → cabinet-process-therapist
mobile-responsiveness → cabinet-small-screen
skills-coverage     → cabinet-roster-check
documentation       → cabinet-record-keeper
process             → cabinet-workflow-cop
performance         → cabinet-speed-freak
```

**13 cabinet members kept their names (just got cabinet- prefix):**
```
accessibility, api-design, architecture, code-quality, consistency,
cor-health, data-integrity, dependency-health, error-handling,
security, testing, ui-patterns, usability
```

**Directory restructure:**
```
# perspectives/ split into three locations:
skills/perspectives/*/           → skills/cabinet-*/     (20 members)
skills/perspectives/_groups.yaml → cabinet/committees.yaml
skills/perspectives/_lifecycle.md → cabinet/lifecycle.md
skills/perspectives/_composition-patterns.md → cabinet/composition-patterns.md
skills/perspectives/_eval-protocol.md → cabinet/eval-protocol.md
skills/perspectives/_prompt-guide.md → cabinet/prompt-guide.md
skills/perspectives/output-contract.md → cabinet/output-contract.md
skills/perspectives/_context.md  → briefing/_briefing.md
# (plus 6 other briefing template files in briefing/)
```

**Phase file renames:**
```
orient/phases/perspectives.md         → orient/phases/cabinet.md
execute/phases/perspectives.md        → execute/phases/cabinet.md
plan/phases/perspective-critique.md   → plan/phases/cabinet-critique.md
audit/phases/perspective-selection.md → audit/phases/member-selection.md
audit/phases/perspective-execution.md → audit/phases/member-execution.md
seed/phases/build-perspective.md      → seed/phases/build-member.md
onboard/phases/generate-context.md    → onboard/phases/generate-briefing.md
```

**SKILL.md frontmatter key changes:**
```yaml
# Old:
context: briefing/_briefing.md
always-on-for: [group1, group2]

# New:
briefing: briefing/_briefing.md
standing-mandate: [committee1, committee2]
```

**Content terminology (in SKILL.md files, phase files, docs):**
- "perspective" → "cabinet member" (in prose)
- "group" → "committee"
- "lane" → "portfolio"
- "activation signals" → "convening criteria"
- "scan scope" → "paths" (in briefing frontmatter)
- "cross-cutting" → "cross-portfolio"

**What did NOT change:**
- `cor-` prefix on infrastructure files (cor-health, cor-upgrade, etc.)
- `.corrc.json` filename
- Database schema field names (`perspective` column in pib-db-schema.sql,
  JSON field in finding-schema.json) — backward compat
- GitHub repo URL (still `orenmagid/claude-on-rails`)
- `_briefing-template.md` files (these are templates, not renamed)

### 5C: Flow Migration Steps (Option A — Clean Reinstall)

1. **Back up all Flow-custom files:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/flow-backup/perspectives /tmp/flow-backup/phases

   # Back up 12 custom perspectives
   for p in life-tracker prep-scout life-optimization philosophical-grounding \
            mantine-quality information-design ui-experimentalist goal-alignment \
            vision gtd sync-health system-tutor; do
     cp -r .claude/skills/perspectives/$p /tmp/flow-backup/perspectives/
   done

   # Back up custom phase files (check each — some may not exist)
   cp .claude/skills/orient/phases/perspectives.md /tmp/flow-backup/phases/orient-cabinet.md 2>/dev/null
   cp .claude/skills/execute/phases/perspectives.md /tmp/flow-backup/phases/execute-cabinet.md 2>/dev/null
   cp .claude/skills/plan/phases/perspective-critique.md /tmp/flow-backup/phases/plan-cabinet-critique.md 2>/dev/null
   # ... any other custom phase files

   # Back up context and groups
   cp .claude/skills/perspectives/_context.md /tmp/flow-backup/
   cp .claude/skills/perspectives/_groups.yaml /tmp/flow-backup/
   ```

2. **Remove old CoR installation:**
   ```bash
   # Remove the entire perspectives directory
   rm -rf .claude/skills/perspectives/

   # Remove old .corrc.json (will be regenerated)
   rm .corrc.json
   ```

3. **Run new Claude Cabinet installer:**
   ```bash
   npx create-claude-cabinet
   ```
   This creates `skills/cabinet-*/`, `cabinet/`, `briefing/`, and a
   fresh `.corrc.json`.

4. **Restore Flow-custom files with new naming:**
   ```bash
   # Move custom perspectives to new paths with cabinet- prefix
   for p in life-tracker prep-scout life-optimization philosophical-grounding \
            mantine-quality information-design ui-experimentalist goal-alignment \
            vision gtd sync-health system-tutor; do
     mv /tmp/flow-backup/perspectives/$p .claude/skills/cabinet-$p
   done

   # Move context to briefing (overwrites the template)
   cp /tmp/flow-backup/_context.md .claude/briefing/_briefing.md

   # Merge _groups.yaml content into committees.yaml
   # MANUAL: open both files, merge Flow's custom groups into the
   # generated committees.yaml, updating member names per the rename map

   # Restore custom phase files with new names
   cp /tmp/flow-backup/phases/orient-cabinet.md .claude/skills/orient/phases/cabinet.md 2>/dev/null
   cp /tmp/flow-backup/phases/execute-cabinet.md .claude/skills/execute/phases/cabinet.md 2>/dev/null
   cp /tmp/flow-backup/phases/plan-cabinet-critique.md .claude/skills/plan/phases/cabinet-critique.md 2>/dev/null
   ```

5. **Update Flow-custom file content:**

   For each of the 12 custom perspective SKILL.md files, update:
   ```yaml
   # Frontmatter changes:
   context: → briefing:
   always-on-for: → standing-mandate:
   # Update any group references to committee names
   ```

   In prose content:
   - "perspective" → "cabinet member"
   - "group" → "committee"
   - "lane" → "portfolio"
   - Reference old member names → new names (e.g., "boundary-conditions" → "boundary-man")

   In custom phase files:
   - Same terminology updates
   - Any path references to `perspectives/` → new locations

   In committees.yaml:
   - Old member names → new names per rename map above
   - "groups:" key → appropriate committee structure

6. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   # All 32 cabinet members discoverable (20 CoR + 12 Flow)
   ls .claude/skills/cabinet-*/SKILL.md | wc -l  # should be 32

   # Infrastructure in place
   ls .claude/cabinet/committees.yaml
   ls .claude/briefing/_briefing.md

   # No stale references
   grep -rn "skills/perspectives/" .claude/
   grep -rn "_groups\.yaml" .claude/
   grep -rn "_context\.md" .claude/ | grep -v "cor-upgrade"

   # Run orient and debrief to verify
   ```

### 5D: Flow Migration Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Custom phase content lost | Low | High | Back up everything first |
| Cabinet member activation breaks | Medium | Medium | Test orient + debrief after migration |
| API calls fail | Low | Low | Endpoints don't change, only file locations |
| cor-upstream-guard blocks valid edits | Medium | Low | Fresh .corrc.json from reinstall |
| Memory files reference old paths | Low | Low | Memory files don't hardcode .claude/ paths |
| Hooks reference old paths | Medium | Medium | Verify all hooks post-migration |
| Custom _groups.yaml entries lost | Low | High | Manual merge into committees.yaml |
| Monolithic _context.md content lost | Low | High | Direct copy to _briefing.md |
| Frontmatter keys not updated | Medium | Medium | Grep for old keys after migration |

### 5E: Package Name Transition

The npm package changed from `create-claude-rails` to `create-claude-cabinet`.
This is a **new package** on the registry, not a rename — npm doesn't support
renames.

**Impact on Flow migration:**
- Flow's `.corrc.json` currently has `"upstreamPackage": "create-claude-rails"`
- Step 3 (reinstall) regenerates `.corrc.json` with `"create-claude-cabinet"`
- `cor-upstream-guard.sh` and `cor-upgrade` don't read `upstreamPackage`
  at runtime — it's just metadata. No functional breakage.
- The old `create-claude-rails` package stays on npm (can deprecate later)

**Install command changes:**
```bash
# Old:
npx create-claude-rails
curl ... install.sh | bash  # install.sh downloads create-claude-rails

# New:
npx create-claude-cabinet
curl ... install.sh | bash  # install.sh downloads create-claude-cabinet
```

No action needed in Flow beyond running the reinstall — the new installer
writes the correct package name.

### 5F: Remaining Steps (Ordered)

The order matters. Some steps create redirects or break paths that later
steps depend on. Do them in this sequence.

#### Step 1: Publish to npm ✅
```bash
npm login          # needs MFA
npm publish --access public
```
This must happen before the GitHub repo rename because `install.sh`
downloads from npm (not GitHub) for the tarball. The npm package name
is already `create-claude-cabinet` — this just puts it on the registry.

After publishing, deprecate the old package:
```bash
npm deprecate create-claude-rails "Renamed to create-claude-cabinet. Run: npx create-claude-cabinet"
```

#### Step 2: Create new GitHub repo `orenmagid/claude-cabinet`
GitHub repo renames create redirects, but a fresh repo is cleaner:

1. Create `orenmagid/claude-cabinet` on GitHub (empty, no README)
2. In the local repo, add the new remote and push:
   ```bash
   cd ~/claude-on-rails
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:orenmagid/claude-cabinet.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. Update all `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs in these files:
   - `install.sh` line 6 (comment)
   - `README.md` lines 29, 147
   - `GETTING-STARTED.md` lines 67, 168
   - `GETTING-STARTED.md` line 185 (issues URL)
   - `templates/skills/cor-upgrade/SKILL.md` line 115
   - `README.md` Philosophy section (Flow repo link — check if it exists)
4. Commit, push to new repo
5. Old repo `orenmagid/claude-on-rails`: add a README that says
   "This project has moved to [claude-cabinet](https://github.com/orenmagid/claude-cabinet)"
   and archive it. GitHub's redirect will handle any old `curl` commands
   in the wild until people update.

**Why new repo instead of rename:** Cleaner break. No ambiguity about
which name is current. The old repo can be archived with a pointer.
GitHub redirects from old→new work for clones and raw URLs, but having
both is belt-and-suspenders.

#### Step 3: Rename local directory
```bash
mv ~/claude-on-rails ~/claude-cabinet
cd ~/claude-cabinet
```

**Claude Code project path impact:**
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-orenmagid-claude-on-rails/` contains
  memory, settings, and conversation history for this project
- After the rename, Claude Code will create a new project path
  `-Users-orenmagid-claude-cabinet/`
- Copy memory files to preserve continuity:
  ```bash
  cp -r ~/.claude/projects/-Users-orenmagid-claude-on-rails/memory \
        ~/.claude/projects/-Users-orenmagid-claude-cabinet/memory
  ```
- The old project path can be left alone or deleted later

**Other impacts:** None. No `npm link` set up. The git remote was
already updated in Step 2. The directory name isn't referenced in
any code or config.

#### Step 4: Re-run lean install (dogfooding)
```bash
cd ~/claude-cabinet
npx create-claude-cabinet --lean --yes
```
This updates the local `.claude/` files and regenerates `.corrc.json`
with the correct package name and paths. Validates that the published
package works.

#### Step 5: Migrate Flow (separate session)
See section 5C above. The full Option A walkthrough.

#### Step 6: Cleanup (whenever)
- Archive `orenmagid/claude-on-rails` on GitHub
- ✅ `npm deprecate create-claude-rails` (done — all 21 versions deprecated)
- Delete `~/.claude/projects/-Users-orenmagid-claude-on-rails/` if
  no longer needed
- Build general-purpose migration into `cor-upgrade` for future users

## Part 6: Commit Strategy

**Two commits landed** for the upstream restructure:
1. `91dffe5` — v0.6.0: Full restructure (directory moves, renames,
   terminology, all 86+ files)
2. `72d7a0c` — Metaphor language pass (docs, skills, install output,
   audit fixes, this migration plan update)

**Separate commit** for GitHub URL updates (after repo rename in Step 2).

**Separate commit** for Flow migration (different repo).

---

## Part 7: What's NOT Changing

To be explicit about what stays the same:

- **Skeleton/phase pattern** — unchanged, just some phase files renamed
- **SKILL.md as discovery mechanism** — unchanged
- **`.corrc.json`** — filename stays (cor- prefix kept)
- **`cor-upstream-guard.sh`** — filename stays
- **`cor-drift-check.cjs`** — filename stays
- **`cor-upgrade`** skill name — stays
- **`cor-health`** cabinet member name — stays
- **Hook architecture** — unchanged
- **Session loop** (orient/debrief) — unchanged behavior
- **Individual cabinet member domain logic** — unchanged (just terminology in prose)
- **Scripts** (merge-findings.js, pib-db.js, etc.) — paths may update but logic unchanged
- **Memory system** — unaffected
- **Claude Code settings.json** — unaffected

---

## Part 8: Post-Restructure TODO (not in this commit)

These are planned future work, noted here so they don't get lost:

- [ ] Build 7 new cabinet members: goal-alignment, information-design,
      user-advocate, ui-experimentalist, vision, framework-quality, gtd
- [ ] Build pre-built variant: mantine-quality (PAIR with framework-quality)
- [ ] Build general-purpose migration into cor-upgrade for future users
- [ ] Rename GitHub repo from `claude-on-rails` to `claude-cabinet`
- [ ] Set up npm redirect from old package name to new
- [ ] Update `~/.claude/cor-registry.json` schema if needed
- [ ] Evaluate whether `cor-` prefix should become `cc-` (low priority)
